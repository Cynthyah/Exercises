# FrogRiverOne - Find the earliest time when a frog can jump to the other side of a river. 

# A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. 
# The frog is initially located on one bank of the river (position 0) and wants to
# get to the opposite bank (position X+1). Leaves fall from a tree onto the surface 
# of the river.

# You are given an array A consisting of N integers representing the falling leaves. 
# A[K] represents the position where one leaf falls at time K, measured in seconds.

# The goal is to find the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of 
# the river. The frog can cross only when leaves appear at every position across the 
# river from 1 to X (that is, we want to find the earliest moment when all the positions 
# from 1 to X are covered by leaves). You may assume that the speed of the current in
# the river is negligibly small, i.e. the leaves do not change their positions once they fall in the river.

# For example, you are given integer X = 5 and array A such that:
# A = [1,3,1,4,2,3,5,4]
# In second 6, a leaf falls into position 5. 
# This is the earliest time when leaves appear in every position across the river.
# If the frog is never able to jump to the other side of the river, the function should return âˆ’1.

# Important
# N and X are integers within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..X].


def solution(X,A):
    check = set()
    for time,num in enumerate(A):
        check.add(num)
        if len(check) == X:
            return time
    return -1
        

# Testing

A = [1,3,1,4,2,3,5,4]
